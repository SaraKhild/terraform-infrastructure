## Title: Automated Infrastructure Deployment on Alibaba Cloud Using Terraform

### Description:
This project demonstrates how to use Terraform for automated deployment and management of 
infrastructure on Alibaba Cloud. By defining infrastructure as code (IaC), this project simplifies the provisioning, 
scaling, and maintenance of cloud resources such as ECS instances, VPCs, 
load balancers, and databases. Leveraging Terraform's declarative syntax,
it enables efficient, consistent, and repeatable deployments, 
allowing for version control and rapid updates to infrastructure. 
Ideal for teams looking to streamline their Alibaba Cloud workflows and improve infrastructure reliability.
